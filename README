The file structure currently contains three main folders that looks like:
index.html #webpage
README
|--src/ #where all the matlab code is in. main.m is in here.
|--images/ #input images
|--output/ # output images

Instructions:
    In order to run all my code, I have a main.m which is currently configured with boolean variables toggled to true to run each individual part. This is located in my "src" folder. Everything should be run from the src folder. In the src folder,
    I currently have 1 "main" file, initialize.m which will do most of the "heavy-lifting." 
    
    The file has boolean variables at the beginning which you can toggle.
    The two main variables are SAVE, GRAPH
    It is currently toggled to be:
    SAVE = false; # when toggled true, it will save to the corresponding output folders.
    GRAPH = false;


========
main.m
========
Run main.m which will run through each of the files listed above earlier.

============
initialize.m
============
Runs through the code where you can choose to use brute-force or jitter sampling methods

=================
luminance_remap.m
=================
Remaps luminance values from A to B - used formula

===========================
Files for naive/brute-force
===========================
image_colorization_brute_force.m - main file for doing brute-force method
transform_fv.m - used to transfer AB channel values after finding best match
compute_fv.m - concatenates fvs used
sd_neighborhood.m - calculates std of each pixel in image around a certain neighborhood

===========================
Files for jitter sampling
===========================
image_colorization_jitter_sampling.m - main file for doing jitter sampling
transfer_sample_fv.m - used to transfer AB channel values after finding best match

============================
Helper files for misc things
============================
load_images.m # loads appropriate images
save_image.m # saves images
